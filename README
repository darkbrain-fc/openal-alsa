The error:

ALSA lib pcm_hw.c:324:(snd_pcm_hw_hw_params) SNDRV_PCM_IOCTL_HW_PARAMS failed: Cannot allocate memory

can be safely ignored in most cases.  It is just the application trying to
allocate more sources than there are free hardware resources to accommodate.

This library can provide at most 21 sources.  It may be more in the future.
Less sources will the available if another application is doing audio playback.

If you are using UT2004 you can suppress this message most of the time by
modifying your ~/.ut2004/System/UT2004.ini as follows:

[ALAudio.ALAudioSubsystem]
Channels=20



If on a Soundblaster Live, in your ~/.openal-speakers you have volumes set
for any more than the first two speakers you should manually zero the
following mixer controls:

Wave Surround Playback Volume
Wave Center Playback Volume
Wave LFE Playback Volume

You may not need to do this on an Audigy or Audigy2 but I've not been able to
test that.
