SPEAKERS:

This directory contains example speaker configuration files.
To use one simple copy it to $HOME/.openal-speakers

The format is simple:

<n>: <gain> <x> <y> <z>

where <n> is a number indication which speaker:

0: front left
1: front right
2: rear left
3: rear right
4: center
5: lfe
6: side left
7: side right

<gain> is a per speaker gain control between 0.0 and 1.0.
Setting the gain to 0.0 disables output to the speaker.

<x> <y> <z> is the speaker position.
<x> is forward, <y> is up and <z> is to the right.
Only the direction of this vector is used.

Anything after a "#" is considered a comment.

speakers-mono:

	This one is just simple example.

speakers-stereo:

	This is the default configuration.  If you are going to use this
you may as well not bother with a speakers file.

speakers-quadraphonic:

	Fourpoint output.  Each speaker placed in different corner of a square.

speakers-fivepoint-a:

	This is what I'm told is the correct placement of speakers in a 5.1 
setup.  The front speakers are 30° from the center speaker and the rear
speakers are 110° from the center speaker.  This is very front biased.
Due to they way I calculate the speaker gain/volume sound behind you ends up
being very quiet.  I know there are schemes I could use that would allow for
this but they don't seems to cope very well with the lack of above of below
speakers.

speakers-fivepoint-b:

	This is the five speakers placed evenly around the listener, such
that they are all 72° from their neighbours.

speakers-fivepoint-c:

	This has the front are rear speakers placed the same as for the
quadraphonic configuration with the addition of the front speaker.

speakers-fivepoint-d:

	This has the speakers each placed 60° from their neighbours.  The
speakers would be placed evenly around the listener in this configuration
if there was a single rear speaker.

speakers-sevenpoint-a:

	I have no idea what the correct placement for 7.1 systems is.  This
is with the front three speakers placed the same as the 5.1 setup.  The
side speakers are placed 90° from the front.  And the rear are placed at
60° from their neighbours.  The end result is a configuration where
everything would be placed evenly around the listener if you take away the
front speaker.
	
speakers-sevenpoint-b:

	This is the seven speakers placed evenly around the listener.
This has them all at some funny angle from their neighbours.

speakers-sevenpoint-c:

	This has the front and rear speakers placed the same as for the 
quadraphonic configuration.  And the side speakers are placed 90° from the
front.  The speakers would be placed evenly around the listener in this
configuration with the addition of a rear center speaker.
